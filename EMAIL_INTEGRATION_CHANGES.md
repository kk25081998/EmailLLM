# Email Integration Changes

## Overview

The email drafting functionality has been completely refactored to integrate seamlessly into the chat conversation flow, removing the need for separate modal dialogs and making the user experience more natural and intuitive.

## Changes Made

### Frontend Changes

#### Chat Component (`frontend/src/components/Chat.js`)

- **Removed email modal**: Eliminated the separate email drafting modal dialog
- **Removed recipient modal**: Eliminated the separate recipient suggestions modal
- **Updated quick actions**: Changed "Draft Email" button to trigger a natural chat message
- **Enhanced placeholder text**: Updated input placeholder to mention email drafting
- **Added example prompts**: Added helpful examples in the empty state
- **Simplified state management**: Removed email-related state variables

#### API Service (`frontend/src/services/api.js`)

- **Removed email endpoints**: Eliminated separate API calls for email drafting
- **Streamlined chat API**: All email functionality now goes through the main chat endpoint

### Backend Changes

#### AI Service (`backend/src/services/aiService.js`)

- **Enhanced system prompt**: Added specific instructions for email drafting in natural conversation
- **Removed separate methods**: Eliminated `draftEmail()`, `draftEmailToAttendees()`, and `suggestEmailRecipients()` methods
- **Integrated functionality**: All email drafting now happens through the main `generateResponse()` method

#### Chat Routes (`backend/src/routes/chat.js`)

- **Removed email endpoints**: Eliminated separate `/draft-email`, `/draft-email-to-attendees`, and `/suggest-recipients` endpoints
- **Enhanced main chat**: The main chat endpoint now handles all email-related requests naturally
- **Maintained calendar context**: Calendar data is still passed to provide context for email drafting

## User Experience Improvements

### Before (Separate Modals)

1. User clicks "Draft Email" button
2. Modal opens with form fields
3. User fills out recipient and purpose
4. Email is generated in modal
5. User copies email from modal
6. Modal closes

### After (Natural Chat)

1. User types: "Can you draft an email to schedule a meeting with john@example.com?"
2. AI responds with complete email draft directly in chat
3. User can continue conversation naturally
4. Email is part of chat history

## Benefits

### Improved User Experience

- **More natural interaction**: Users can ask for emails in their own words
- **Contextual responses**: AI can ask clarifying questions if needed
- **Conversation flow**: Email drafting doesn't interrupt the chat flow
- **Better accessibility**: No modal dialogs to navigate

### Simplified Architecture

- **Fewer endpoints**: Reduced API complexity
- **Unified interface**: All AI interactions go through one endpoint
- **Easier maintenance**: Less code to maintain
- **Better error handling**: Centralized error management

### Enhanced Functionality

- **Context awareness**: AI can use calendar data and attendee information
- **Flexible requests**: Users can be more specific or general
- **Follow-up questions**: AI can ask for clarification naturally
- **Rich responses**: Can include multiple email options or suggestions

## Example Interactions

### Email Drafting

```
User: "Can you draft an email to schedule a meeting with sarah@company.com about the Q4 budget review?"

AI: "Here's a professional email draft for you:

Subject: Q4 Budget Review Meeting Request

Hi Sarah,

I hope this email finds you well. I'd like to schedule a meeting to discuss the Q4 budget review.

Based on our recent collaboration on the quarterly planning, I believe this discussion would be valuable for both of us to align on priorities and resource allocation.

Could you please let me know your availability for next week? I'm flexible between Tuesday and Thursday, and can accommodate your schedule.

Looking forward to our discussion.

Best regards,
[Your name]"
```

### Recipient Suggestions

```
User: "Who should I email about the project timeline?"

AI: "Based on your recent meetings, here are some suggestions for who to email about the project timeline:

1. **John Smith (john@company.com)** - You had 3 meetings with him this week, including the "Project Kickoff" and "Timeline Review" meetings. He seems to be heavily involved in the project planning.

2. **Sarah Johnson (sarah@company.com)** - You met with her twice this week for "Resource Allocation" discussions. She would likely need to be informed about timeline changes.

3. **Mike Chen (mike@company.com)** - From your "Stakeholder Update" meeting, he appears to be a key stakeholder who should be kept in the loop.

Would you like me to draft an email to any of these recipients?"
```

# Attendee Email Extraction & Management Features

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive attendee management features that have been implemented to address the requirement of extracting emails from calendar events and using them for email drafting and communication management.

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Original Issue**: The application wasn't extracting attendee emails from calendar events, making it impossible to draft emails to meeting participants.

**Solution**: Implemented a complete attendee management system that extracts, processes, and utilizes attendee information from Google Calendar events for intelligent email drafting and communication management.

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 1. Enhanced Google Calendar Service

#### Attendee Data Extraction

```javascript
// Enhanced event processing with attendee information
processAttendees(attendees) {
  return attendees.map(attendee => ({
    email: attendee.email,
    displayName: attendee.displayName || attendee.email.split('@')[0],
    responseStatus: attendee.responseStatus || 'needsAction',
    self: attendee.self || false,
    organizer: attendee.organizer || false,
    optional: attendee.optional || false
  }));
}
```

#### New API Methods

- `getEventById(eventId)` - Get detailed event information
- `getAttendeesForEvent(eventId)` - Get attendees for specific event
- `getAllAttendees(weekStart)` - Get all unique attendees for the week
- `getAttendeesByMeetingType(weekStart)` - Categorize attendees by meeting type

### 2. Enhanced API Endpoints

#### Calendar Endpoints

```http
GET /api/calendar/events/:eventId
GET /api/calendar/events/:eventId/attendees
GET /api/calendar/attendees
GET /api/calendar/attendees/categorized
```

#### Chat/AI Endpoints

```http
POST /api/chat/draft-email-to-attendees
POST /api/chat/suggest-recipients
POST /api/chat/analyze-attendees
```

### 3. AI Service Enhancements

#### Context-Aware Email Drafting

```javascript
async draftEmailToAttendees(eventId, purpose, calendarData = null) {
  // Find the specific event and its attendees
  const event = calendarData.events.find(e => e.id === eventId);
  const attendees = event.attendees.filter(a => !a.self);

  // Generate email with attendee context
  const prompt = `Draft a professional email to the attendees of "${event.title}" for ${purpose}.
  Attendees: ${attendees.map(a => `${a.displayName} (${a.email})`).join(', ')}`;
}
```

#### Email Recipient Suggestions

```javascript
async suggestEmailRecipients(context, calendarData = null) {
  // Analyze recent meeting attendees and suggest appropriate recipients
  const attendees = calendarData.attendees;

  const prompt = `Based on the context "${context}", suggest the most appropriate email recipients from this list of recent meeting attendees:
  ${attendees.map(attendee =>
    `- ${attendee.displayName} (${attendee.email}) - ${attendee.meetings.length} recent meetings`
  ).join('\n')}`;
}
```

## 🎨 User Interface Features

      <Users size={10} />
      {event.attendees.filter((a) => !a.self).length}
    </div>
  );
}
```
